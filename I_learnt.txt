1. I learnt how to reverse an array using two logics

a. I developed the first one myself using for loop
    create a new array
    loop through the array to be reversed (using the variable i for this doc)
    set the i of the new array to be  arrayToBeReversed[ arrayToBeReversed.length - 1 - i ] 
        - 1 because array indexing starts from 0
        - i so it keeps reducing as te value of i increases


b. I then gave to chatGpt who gave me another method using array destructuring and while loop


2.  I also learnt array destrucutring and array swapping

      let a = ["ab", "cd", "ef", "gh"]
      let b = ["zx", "sf", "ff"]
      const c = a
      a = b
      b = c
      console.log(a)

      // const [z, y, x, w] = a
      // console.log(z)
